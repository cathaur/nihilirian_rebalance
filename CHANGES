This is a list of changes from the original.

Balance changes:

* Reduced the armor gain from the Artificial Shields upgrade from 10 to 1.
   +10 armor made Automacer take almost no damage from Ordantte and Atir.

* Double the souls produced by soul buildings.
   It was annoying to have to make so many.  Also, this greatly improves CPU
   player performance.

Miscellaneous:
* Corrected spelling of Wisdom Development
