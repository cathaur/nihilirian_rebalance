This is a modification of the original Nihilirian techtree,
for the purpose of making balance and other minor changes to the xml.

To set up this repository on your machine:

You probably want to put it in your megaglest techs directory:
$ cd ~/.megaglest/techs/

Then clone this repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/cathaur/nihilirian_rebalance.git

Or you can put it somewhere else and make a symlink at
  ~/.megaglest/techs/nihilirian_rebalance .

Since this repository contains only text files, you will need to copy
the original Nihilirian assets over:
Assuming you have the original Nihilirian techtree at
  ~/.megaglest/techs/nihilirian, then:
$ cd ~/.megaglest/techs/nihilirian_rebalance
$ cp -nR ../nihilirian/* ./
$ rm nihilirian.xml
