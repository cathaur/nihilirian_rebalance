current issues (not exhaustive):

Sirius is too weak and produces its early units too slowly.  Automacer is
still better for the cost than Ordantte, so Sirius is at a disadvantage unless
it can rush with Ordantte, and possibly also Atir.
  Solution: reduce production time for Sirius early buildings and units.

Atomica is overpowered.  It has a lot of DPS and splash and also has the
largest range after Bionic Implants.  In addition, it can be produced earlier
than Reinaraa and Spiritea, making the latter two useless.
  Solution: reduce range and maybe also the damage of Atomica; reduce Bionic
  Implants range gain.

Previous point aside, Spiritea takes too long to make, and does not do more
DPS than Reinaraa.  It costs about double of Reinaraa, has about double the
HP, and has a bit more range.  It's probably more effective to just make
double the Reinaraa.
  Solution: make Spiritea be produced faster and do more damage.

Strong units of Sirius use too much soul.
